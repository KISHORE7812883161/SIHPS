## Register Number:212221043003
## Name: KISHORE M
## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description

Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Discover local e-waste recycling centers with our E-Waste Facility Locator. Easily find nearby facilities, ensure proper disposal of electronics, and contribute to a cleaner, greener environment. Start recycling today!
